# Requesting PLP RTO Access

DevOps teams are used to request PLP resources through the [PLP Portal](https://portal.plp.kadaster.nl). The authorization model is based 
on the following key components:
- the PLP customer  
A Kadaster Business Service (application) runs on computing resources connected to a PLP Customer.
- the PLP environment  
The Kadaster Business Service runs in a protected (network) environment: ONT(wikkel (Development environment)), INT(egration and test), 
FTO (Functional Test Environment), RTO (Restore Test Environment) and PROD(uction).
- the PLP \<customer\>-\<environment\>-adm role
