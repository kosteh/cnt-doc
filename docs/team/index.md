## Contact
Be aware that each contact costs some valuable time of our team. The normal flow of getting help is:

1. Use `Google` or `ChatGPT` (and others), they are our robotic Internet and AI friends. They know more than we do ;-).  
`WARNING: do not feed these tools with Kadaster specific information or questions !`
1. Ask your `team collegues` .
